### Find out more about the phenomenon of the Hype Train, and whether youâ€™re in one of its carriages.

Hereâ€™s a description of Annaâ€™s talk on [NorDevConâ€™s own website](https://nordevcon.com):

> "As developers, we often find ourselves on the hype train; it's cool, it's amazing, and it's as full of shiny stuff as any magpie's nest. However, we never seem to ask why, or even if it's the right place to be. This talk is about thinking critically about the hype train, finding a balance between shiny and boring but stable. I'll share some cautionary tales from different corners of the industry, and draw on my own experience, before talking about stereotypes around "enterprise" languages and why they don't always deserve it. Hopefully, attendees will leave with a little bit more perspective on the hype train, and better equipped to think critically about it."

Whether youâ€™re in tech or in any other field, this particular talk touches on the common denominator between all of them: the human factor and the human psychology. Annaâ€™s presentation may be aimed at the more senior-level employees and business owners, however due to the nature of the talk, this should be perfect for audiences of all levels of techi-ness, or lack thereof!

Interested? Have an extra glimpse at what our speaker has to say:

## ðŸš‚ What inspired you to choose this particular topic for your talk?

**Anna**: The hype train is a massive part of developer culture: we're almost all on it to an extent,  running after one shiny new thing after another. I've unfortunately seen the consequences this can have. I love working with legacy software, well away from the hype, so, I've developed a different perspective on the whole matter and wanted to share that way of seeing things, and hopefully equip others to look at things more critically.

## ðŸš‚ Who would find your talk useful?

**Anna**: I think that it would probably appeal to more senior engineers in particular, who are thinking critically about the way they do things, but it should be suitable for most people in IT, or IT project management.

## ðŸš‚ If you could give us 1-3 main takeaways for your upcoming talk, what would they be?

**Anna**: The key takeaway is that our obsession with the new and shiny when it comes to dev tools, frameworks etc can be a double-edged sword.

## ðŸš‚ Will there be any specific tools, technologies or frameworks that you will be talking about?

**Anna**: Not specifically.

## ðŸš‚ What kind of audience engagement do you prefer?

**Anna**: I love questions, so will definitely want to have them at the end of the talk, might do a show of hands during the talk.
