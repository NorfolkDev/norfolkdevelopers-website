### As with some of the other talks at NorDevCon2024, Damien will address, and tackle the human side of the technology, and its role in the professional world, comparing and contrasting it with the other fields:

> Embarking on a journey to explore the intricate world of costs associated with pursuing a career in software development, and intriguingly, we shall compare these practices with those employed in various other industries.

We have taken the liberty of asking Damien some more probing questions, the answers to which we have made you very much partial to, as our very own community. The answers below may portray Damien as a man of few words — which we personally see as one of the hallmarks of professionalism.

## 🌿 What inspired you to choose this particular topic for your talk?

**Damien**: Looking at the cost of employment from the employees perspective is rarely discussed. This talk aims to share what’s on the other side of the fence.

## 🌿 If you could give us 1-3 main takeaways for your upcoming talk, what would they be?

**Damien**:

* How much it actually costs to find a job.
* Comparing jobs across the industries.

## 🌿 What kind of audience engagement do you prefer, if any?

**Damien**: I am open to both. It’s good to have an audience engaged and asking questions. I will of course try and raise a little bit of laughter.

## 🌿 Are there any “teasers” you could give us?

**Damien**: Just a few funny stories that hopefully make the talk humorous and engaging.
