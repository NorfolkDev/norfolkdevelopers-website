### Have a read about Ignat’s upcoming talk _and_ take a sneak-peek at the additional information our speaker shared with us!

If you follow the link to our [website](https://nordevcon.com), you will see the following description of Mr Korchagin’s upcoming Keynote:

> "Nowadays, there are many attack vectors an adversary can employ to either break into the system or impact its operations. Oftentimes a successful attack is a clever combination of smaller vectors, which on their own do not seem very important or dangerous. That’s why to efficiently mitigate modern Internet threats the system should be built with the “defense in depth” in mind. In this presentation we will discuss the various approaches and technical solutions Cloudflare implemented to protect infrastructure and services from the biggest Internet threats. We will review a layered approach to security starting from the Internet itself, then data centre networking, server and operating systems layers, application and service layers. We will see how the Internet today has become the global “security perimeter” and how to protect modern cloud workloads and corporate services."

However, being as in-depth and, dare-we-say, pedantic, as you’d expect a cohort of tech-heads to be, we have decided to probe deeper into the nature of the topic and asked our speaker some questions to get some additional insight. 

This is what we got:

## What inspired you to choose this particular topic for your talk?

**Ignat**: People often think that sophisticated and effective defence online requires some extraordinary expensive hardware or fancy AI solutions etc. I would like to show that it is possible to build such a defence with existing (open source) tools and technologies. Moreover, one of the main points is that expensive hardware is usually the worst solution.

## Who would find your talk useful?

**Ignat**: The talk would be interesting to all technologists, because it describes how the Internet works.

## If you could give us 1-3 main takeaways for your upcoming talk, what would they be?

**Ignat**:

* expensive hardware boxes are usually not the best solution to protect yourself from modern Internet attacks.
* Internet attacks usually scale horizontally, so should your Internet defence.
* practice defence in depth: there is no one-for-all solution - only a layered defence can protect the Infrastructure from modern Internet threats.

## Will there be any specific tools, technologies or frameworks that you will be talking about?

**Ignat**: We will be talking about the Internet, how it works and also a little bit about Linux operating system.

We, of course, encourage you to meet Ignat up close and personal at the upcoming [NorDevCon 2024](https://ti.to/norfolkdevelopers/nordevcon-24), but if fate has it otherwise, you can also check out his work and get in touch with him via his [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ignatk).

If you haven't already, you can, of course, get the tickets to see Ignat and other speakers [here](https://ti.to/norfolkdevelopers/nordevcon-24).

Thanks,
Mez, Alex, Ida, & The nor(DEV):con Team
