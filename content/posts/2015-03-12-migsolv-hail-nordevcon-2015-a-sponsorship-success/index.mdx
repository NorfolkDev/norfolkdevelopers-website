It was great being at this years NorDevCon event in Norwich. Held at the Kings Centre in central Norwich it attracted an amazing amount of creative people and business opportnuities. We believe it is the event to be at for local tech businesses wanting to be seen and take part in Norwich’s growing tech community, now being an officially announced national tech city. As a local data centre provider, technology companies are, and will be, our obvious business partners, and we certainly had great conversations with a number of them. We are progressing some and a good conversation with AWS has lead to more meetings – who knows where this will go?

We are optimistic and will be here again next year.
