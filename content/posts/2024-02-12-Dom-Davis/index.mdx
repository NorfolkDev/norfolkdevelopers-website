Given the increasing awareness, recognition and celebration of neurodiversity worldwide (and specifically in the STEM fields), this talk is aimed to balance out the tech-side of things, and provide more relatable human input.

> “Dom Davis is a Senior Developer currently working at [Revelio Labs](https://www.reveliolabs.com). He’s lived most of his life with undiagnosed Autism — something that had only changed in the past few years. He will share a very personal side to his experience, which you will either be able to relate to yourself or recognise and understand someone from your colleagues, friends, or family.

## 🧠 What inspired you to choose this particular topic for your talk?

**Dom**: As someone who’s been recently diagnosed with Autism it’s something that hits very close to home. There also seems to be a lot of misunderstanding about the subject, something I hope to address.


## 🧠 How do you think your talk will benefit software developers and programmers? Would it benefit people in other fields, if so, who do you think may find it most rewarding?

**Dom**: Given the number of neurodiverse people this field seems to attract, I’d say it would very much benefit software developers. If you’re autistic, or otherwise neurodivergent yourself then you may pick up some hints and tips; and if you’re not, you will find some great advice on working with people who are.

## 🧠 If you could give 1-3 takeaways in bullet points or short phrases, what are the key takeaways that attendees can expect from your talk?

**Dom**: We’ll be looking at the seeming explosion of people with autism; what it really means to be on the spectrum; and the good, the bad and the ugly with the whole TikTok thing.

## 🧠 What kind of audience engagement do you prefer, if any? Would you be engaging with the audience during your talk, or would you encourage people to ask you questions after your talk?

**Dom**: My talks tend to be “on rails”, and so convoluted that questions are best left until the end. But if it absolutely, positively cannot wait then sure, why not ;)

## 🧠 If there were any kind of “teaser” bit of info you would like us to share with us/the audience now, to create a bit of interest or mystery in regards to what you will be talking about, what would it be?

**Dom**: I’m left-handed. No, I won’t explain further.

## 🧠 Finally, are there any additional links you would like us to include in the posts, so that people could find out more about you or check out your work?

**Dom**: If you’ve seen me speak before then you probably know what you’re getting yourself into. If you haven’t, then there’s a bunch of my talks on [GitHub](https://github.com/domdavis/talks) that you can check out.
