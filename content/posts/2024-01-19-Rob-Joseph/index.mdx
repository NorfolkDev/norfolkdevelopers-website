### It won’t be an exaggeration to say that almost every one of us has, at some point, considered remote work, or contract work as opposed to a seemingly more secure 9-to-5 alternative.

If you’d like to find out more, or if you’re still on the fence about it, Rob would be the person to listen to, and then consequently ask the questions:

> Rob J has been a contract developer since 2012. He's worked with more than 23 clients, with user bases ranging from 1,000 to 1m+. He's seen the best in development, and the worst. He's been paid on time, paid late and not paid at all. You name it, he's experienced it. In this talk Rob is going to take you behind the scenes of what it's really like to be a contract developer - the pro's, the con's, and whether it's really worth moving away from permanent employment!

With this, let’s get some additional inside scoop from our speaker 😉

## 👩‍💻 What inspired you to choose this particular topic for your talk?

**Rob**: Over the past twelve years as a contractor, I've worked alongside some great developers who were always interested in how the contracting world works — so I really wanted to enlighten people as to what it's really like and whether it's worth switching to it.

## 👩‍💻 How do you think your talk will benefit software developers and programmers?

**Rob**: I think it will benefit everyone who is interested in a better work-life balance, earning more money or gaining a wider range of experience compared to what a single job can offer.

## 👩‍💻 If you could give us 1-3 main takeaways for your upcoming talk, what would they be?

**Rob**:

* Contracting will earn you more money, in less time
* The truth about "job security"
* Why contracting isn't for everyone

## 👩‍💻 What kind of audience engagement do you prefer, if any? Would you be engaging with the audience during your talk, or would you encourage people to ask you questions after your talk?

**Rob**: Both 🤗


## 👩‍💻 Are there any “teasers” you could give us?

**Rob**: We all (hopefully) enjoy our work, but let's face it — we work to get paid. Contracting WILL earn you more money, and give you more free time. You'll have to watch to learn more 😎

## 👩‍💻 Finally, are there any additional links you would like us to include in the posts, so that people could find out more about you or check out your work?

**Rob**: You can find out more about me at [robj.me](robj.me)

We, of course, encourage you to meet Rob up close and personal at the upcoming [NorDevCon 2024](https://ti.to/norfolkdevelopers/nordevcon-24), but if fate has it otherwise, you can also check out his work (see above) and get in touch with him via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/therobj)

If you haven't already, you can, of course, get the tickets to see Rob and other speakers at our [Conference](https://tito/norfolkdevelopers/nordevcon-24).
