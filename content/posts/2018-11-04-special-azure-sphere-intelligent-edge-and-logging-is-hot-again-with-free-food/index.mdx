### Azure Sphere: Intelligent Edge (plus an update on Norfolk network and smart sensor concepts)

Industry largely underestimates the critical societal need to embody the highest levels of security in every network-connected device – every child’s toy, every household’s appliances, and every industry’s equipment. High development and maintenance costs have limited strong security to high-cost or high margin devices. Azure Sphere brings together the best of Microsoft’s expertise in cloud, software, and silicon—resulting in a unique approach to security that starts in the silicon and extends to the cloud. This session will give a short brief on two projects I have been working on for some time. Azure Sphere and the Norfolk wide deployment of The Things Network LoRaWAN. Both present enormous opportunities for technology solutions and broad societal impact. And honestly, I can make this fun and entertaining – I promise!

Since joining Microsoft in 1994, Paul Foster has worked across a wide range of sectors and customers, providing a mix of technical and strategic guidance around the creative use of technology in relation to their business needs. Paul is currently a senior software engineer at Microsoft, focused on the building of next generation sensor webs which automate the gathering of data from disparate sources, and how to enable the creative analysis of this data to start a new era of perception. He is the initiator of The Things Network Norfolk community group. For a short-time Paul was a member of a high-wire flying trapeze circus troupe, is a keen roboticist and an international marathon runner.

### Logging Is Hot Again - Gael Fraiteur (PostSharp - postsharp.net)

If you think logging is boring, stop yawning and think again.

Designed for the ages of monolithic synchronous applications running in data centers or on the desktop, traditional text-file-oriented logging frameworks such as log4net or nlog are becoming obsolete. New tools, best-practices and standards are emerging to make sense out of massively distributed and asynchronous applications that run in the cloud, in containers, or in mobile devices. Solutions for a world where storage and computing power are cheap and can be provisioned within minutes.

Starting with the question:

> “What do we want to log and why?”

This talk gives a bird’s eye overview of the new logging landscape. It introduces open-source solutions like Elasticsearch, Fluentd or OpenTracing, and commercial services like Application Insights. On a code level, it shows how PostSharp can help to generate highly detailed logs with minimal efforts.

The key takeaway of this talk is a broad understanding of the business of logging and application instrumentation, so you’re ready to make choices on your own.
