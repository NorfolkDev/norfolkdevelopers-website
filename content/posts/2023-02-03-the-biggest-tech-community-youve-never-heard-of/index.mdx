Most people already know that Aviva, the massive UK insurer and financial
services company, was founded in Norwich and still has a big presence in the
city. But what might surprise you is just how big a part technology plays in the
company’s operations.

There are over 900 people working in tech teams in Aviva’s Norwich offices,
making it one of the largest tech employers in the county.

Like many firms of a similar size, it’s right in the middle of a digital
transformation. But the scale of investment in the tech stack and the people at
Aviva seem to be quite something. There are teams working with AI, massive
datasets to mine for insights and strategies, and as you’d expect, a world class
cyber-security operation.

Of course, if you’re like me, you might well think of the insurance industry as
classically ‘pale, male and stale’, but a quick glance at their
[careers website](https://careers.aviva.co.uk/our-teams/technology/) shows a
different story. Across the UK, only 17% of technology employees are female.
Changing this is a challenge which Aviva has clearly taken up. For starters,
they’re the first insurance company to join the Tech Talent Charter, which is
working to boost gender diversity in the UK tech industry.

Another example: the company has created a dedicated network,
[Women in Tech](https://careers.aviva.co.uk/working-at-aviva/women-in-tech/),
designed to use networking, coaching and support to give women a career boost.
The company even sends female tech ambassadors out to schools, spreading the
word that you don’t need to study tech to work in tech.

And you’ll also find a fascinating film about how society helps push into the
gendered careers we think we should be doing, rather than the ones that really
interest us. You can check that out here.

There’s also a programme specifically for people returning to the workforce
after time out of the workplace, called the Tech Returners programme. This is
open to you if you’ve been on a career break for more than two years – and it
could be a lifesaver if you’re feeling like things have moved on too much while
you were away.

Take a look around the website and you’ll find that there are plenty of roles
available for graduates: engineers, analysts, developers, architects, project
managers and more. But Aviva also seems to be big on apprentices too.
Apprenticeships are a great route into a more formalised tech career –
particularly for those of us who are less traditionally academic, or who have
taught ourselves to code.

And if you think the apprenticeship train has long since departed for you, hope
is at hand. Aviva states:

> Apprenticeships aren’t just for school leavers. Our apprentices come from all
> walks of life and age groups. While some join straight from school or college,
> many are career changers looking for a fresh challenge, or returning to the
> workplace after a career break.

From the looks of things, the 2023 graduate roles have just closed, but the
apprenticeship programmes are still open for new entries. Could this be the next
step on your tech career? You can check the Aviva careers website out
