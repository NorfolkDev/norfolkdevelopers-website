## The 10th NorDevCon!

We celebrated in February; delving into the future of technology. This year's
conference saw a remarkable increase in participation. Over 400 people came
through those doors, with attendees exploring new opportunities & questions
aplenty. Connections made with peers and the corridor conference was great to
see! We hope you enjoyed every moment of the learning, debate and networking.

We’re writing to review some of the highlights, feedback, finances, and make
some acknowledgements.

### Event Highlights

This year’s event featured a variety of engaging sessions and workshops. Notable
keynotes included talks from industry pioneers who shared their insights on the
future of tech, the importance of psychological safety in the workplace, and
strategies for building inclusive software.

The return of the panel discussions in 2024 was very well received, they’ll
definitely feature prominently this year, with plans to ease audience engagement
too 👀! Delegates took deep dives into topics like machine learning, networking
& cybersecurity. A track dedicated to careers was also a big highlight and cited
as amongst many a delegate's favourite sessions.

The diverse range of experience levels among participants was impressive, and
the feedback reflected this. Our carefully curated sessions catered to everyone
from beginners to seasoned professionals, ensuring that everyone found something
valuable to take away; and that was evident in our polls:

### Community Impact

NorDevCon continues to be a platform for career growth and community building.
We successfully connected graduates with intern opportunities, juniors with
their first roles, and senior developers looking for the next step in their
careers!

A highlight of our community efforts was the fundraising for The Feed
Foundation. We doubled the amount raised last year, with a total of £1252
collected in just under two days. This incredible generosity supports essential
services like community cafes, social supermarkets, and mental health workshops,
demonstrating the caring spirit of our NorDevCon community.

### Finances

As part of our on-going commitment to transparency we’d like to share some of
the costs and assure you of our commitment to “not-for-profit”. We saw an
increase in our costs across the board this year, however we were pleased to
welcome more partners:

| **Total**                              |            | £2,528.97  |

We’re taking it a step further this year; and we want to share some of the
finances that are behind the nor(DEV): community itself, each year we talk about
directing any profits back into putting on events throughout the year.
[Norfolk Developers is a private limited company](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/09500154)
with the all the associated costs that normally go into running a business. So,
what does that look like?

Here’s our 2023/24 in the numbers:

|                 | Debit     | Credit     |
| --------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Event Fund      | £2,234.92 |            |
| Accountancy     | £1,683.20 |            |
| Marketing       | £957.07   |            |
| Corporation Tax | £1,286.66 |            |
| IT Expense      | £1,062.06 |            |
| Insurances      | £79.78    |            |
| Loans           |           | £2,784.80  |
| **Subtotals**   | £7,303.69 | £2,784.80  |
| **Total**       |           | -£4,518.89 |

We were able to direct over £2k towards social events throughout the year,
including supporting other communities

Our Marketing spend shot up though; and was mostly spent on Mailchimp’s
subscription (at £500.42) rather than actual direct marketing. We’re migrating
to a more affordable alternative this year. The surprise tax bill was painful.
We understand this to be because of effectively running two conferences in one
tax cycle. The conference return in June 2022 after avoiding the winter (for
"reasons") and then promptly had another in February 2023. We anticipate a
rebate on this, following our 23/24 filing 🙏.

One piece of feedback we've been a little surpised by has been; "the tickets are
extraordinary cheap". This was an intentional choice, and is a desire; we want
an affordable and accessible conference. Through our scholarship programme, we
were able to offer:

- 22x Free Workshop Spaces
- 54x Free Student Tickets
- 15x Scholarship Tickets

One suggestion has been to adopt a "Commercial Ticket" model. We take
inspiration from fellows, PyCon. So, in 2025 we introduce this ticket, offered
at our standard pricing and for companies with >5 employees. Our Super-Early &
Early Bird Tickets will still be available, but to small companies and those
that are self-funded.

### Testimonials

Delegates praised the event for its organisation (🤷 always feels like chaos to
us), the quality of the sessions, and the opportunities for networking. Many
highlighted the positive impact of the conference on their professional growth
and their appreciation for the inclusive atmosphere.

A vital element of the feedback though was the quality of AV, with particular
attention to the projectors. There were plenty of other suggestions for
improvement, which is the most valuable of feedback and enabling us to continue
to improve the quality of the conference.

### Support and Acknowledgments

The conference would not have been possible without the generous support of our
sponsors and partners. Their contributions ensured the event's success and
helped us provide valuable resources to our attendees.

We also want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our volunteers and organisers,
whose dedication and hard work made this event a memorable experience for
everyone.

### Conclusion

NorDevCon 2024 was a resounding success, bringing together a vibrant community
of techies to learn, share, and grow. As we look forward to future events, we
remain committed to fostering an inclusive and dynamic community.
