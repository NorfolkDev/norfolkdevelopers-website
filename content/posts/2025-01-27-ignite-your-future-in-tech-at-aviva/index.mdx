### You’ve been at Aviva for over 20 years. How have you seen their tech journey evolve from when you started to what you're working on now?

I joined Aviva as a graduate, so never planned to stay for this long. But
actually, it's a testament to the journey and the different things that I've
been able to do over that time, and it has been a really fun journey. Early on,
I launched the first-ever “e-commerce platform” at Aviva. It was probably a
slightly misnamed platform for what it did, but it was the first time we were
communicating digitally with customers, through live chat functionality. At the
time, that was amazing – the idea that we were communicating with customers not
through paper, email, or over the phone, but digitally. It felt like a big deal.

The digital revolution has been incredible, but for me, all the elements that go
with it are just as fascinating. Cybersecurity, which is one of my specialisms,
has been crucial — securing evolving technologies throughout that journey is
incredible. Now, I’m the Generative AI sponsor across Aviva, leading our work
with Gen AI. It's a once-in-a-generation technological revolution.

We're exploring its potential to enrich both customer and colleague experiences,
while also considering how to secure it, manage risks, ensure ethical practices,
and take sustainable steps. We couldn’t have imagined Gen AI when I started, but
now we're early adopters in a cautious, yet forward-thinking, way.

### What are some topics relating to Gen AI that you feel are underrepresented, or should be talked about more?

I’d like to see more press coverage of the positive human elements. It’s easy to
see clickbait about Gen AI taking jobs or robots taking over. But no technology
is inherently good or bad; it depends on how you use it.

We’ve seen Gen AI tools helping neurodiverse people thrive at work, and our own
frontline workers at Aviva are positive about how it helps them focus on
customers rather than admin tasks. It’s an augmentation, not a replacement, and
it’s opening up amazing opportunities.

### If you had advice for people trying to understand Gen AI’s impact on their future, what would it be?

I’d advise people to understand what it is – and crucially what it isn’t.
There’s a mystique around Gen AI, but if you break it down, it’s a model trained
on data to generate content. It’s not magic; it doesn’t have consciousness.
Understanding what it is and isn’t, and how to use it, is key. We’re training
everyone at Aviva on Gen AI, so we move on a positive journey. Demystifying it
is essential.

### What are your predictions for the future of Gen AI in your sector?

I see Gen AI enabling materially different customer outcomes. It’s not about
removing humans; it’s about freeing up our people from day-to-day admin and
distractions so they can focus fully on customers in their time of need. That
enhanced human-to-human connection is really exciting for our industry.
