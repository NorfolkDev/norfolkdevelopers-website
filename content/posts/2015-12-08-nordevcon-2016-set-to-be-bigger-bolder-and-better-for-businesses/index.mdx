> “Once again we’re proud to lead the way with nor(DEV):con, now in it’s fourth year. It’s all about helping the tech community to reach out to the wider business community to demonstrate how we can all work together for stronger, more efficient businesses. Norfolk continues to be tipped as one to watch in the UK’s technology sector and is already considered a centre of technical excellence. Today technology is so ingrained and intertwined with the local economy that one cannot exist without the other and nor(DEV):con is a celebration of this.”

The content-rich conference will feature keynote speeches, workshops and talks from industry influencers, including:
