## What an awesome two days!

At NorDevCon23, we were able to explore the future of tech with a focus on the
latest trends in development; whilst also exploring the ecosystem that surrounds
great software delivery.

We connected graduates with intern opportunities, juniors with their first
roles, and seniors looking to the next step in their careers. We learned about
how our human brains work, psychological safety, and the importance of fostering
an environment where ideas can be expressed without fear or judgment. We learned
how to make software that more people can use and how to get more diversity
involved in making that software. We sincerely hope you had a great time
learning, debating, and networking with each other.

## Demographics

A large driver behind Norfolk Developers is to create an inclusive, dynamic and
welcoming space for all. Encouraging diversity, encourages a diversity of
thought. Our speakers this year spoke on this matter in depth. Whilst we look
forward to sharing the recordings of these talks very soon, they’re not quite
ready yet.

We will mention some of the results of our feedback form though because we're
proud to share!

### Gender

We saw a signifant increase in attendance from Females this year. A sign that
our regions investments into addressing this inbalance are making a great
impact. We'd also like to think that this also speaks to the inclusive and
welcoming nature of our community too :heart:!

### Experience

Just look at this incredible spread of knowledge; we were able to select talks
for a range of experience levels this year and that's reflected upon in a lot of
the feedback we've received!

## A HUGE increase in our scholarship program! :heart: :heart: :heart:!

This year, we made getting a scholarship ticket easier than ever with our "pay
what you want" ticket available to anyone on an honor system.

A total of 70 attended over the two days!

We also reached out and welcomed more students that ever, with our free school
ticket scheme. We were thrilled to have students and their teachers attending
from Thorpe St Andrew, Sir Isaacs, Access Creative, and City College (CCN).

> We felt really welcome and it was a great trip. I'm very conscious it's not
> aimed at children (or teachers) but we were able to choose talks that were
> accessible.

## Feedback

Every year we invite you to provide your
[feedback](https://forms.gle/n3r9BchQsUAK2qRm9) on the conference. Having
feedback from guests helps us improve the overall communication, experience and
outcomes of the event. We are truly grateful for those who have taken to time to
provide it.

Following on from 2022, a large piece of feedback was in regard to the session
timings with little to no gap for delegates to find a seat for their next talk.
This year we went from 45min to 40min talks within the same schedule and it's
clear from this year's feedback that has worked to some extent but that we also
need to find other ways to improve the flow of people and signposting to next
talks in a more efficient way.

## Finances

Beginning this year we're going to report on the finances that go into running
NorDevCon.

We ran the conference at a loss this year; however, it is never our goal
to profit and any profits we do make are pumped right back into both our own
community and fellows too.

Whilst Tech is one of the region's critical economic drivers, as you have
probably seen in the media, it isn’t immune to economic conditions. This has led
to difficulties in establishing partnerships this year with budgets being
restricted. Naturally, we support these decisions and look forward to welcoming
them as sponsors in 2024!

Anyway, let's take a look at the numbers:

### Conference

| **Total**                              |                | **-£3,304.13** |

### Investments

We made a signifant upgrade to our hardware this year, sunsetting our 720p
camcorders and welcoming 4k camcorders and video mixers to our inventory.

| Item                            |         Cost |
| ------------------------------- | -----------: |
| 3x 4k Camcorders                |    £2,132.20 |
| 2x Video Mixers                 |      £578.00 |
| Storage (SD Cards, Hard Drives) |      £483.92 |
| 2x Tripods                      |       £65.98 |
| Banners                         |         £360 |
| **Total**                       | **-£3620.1** |

#### Why don't your hire the equipment?

We had a few questions both prior and during the conference as to why we don't
hand over the job to a production company.

**Cost!!** Of the estimates we received, most were way above the investment cost
and having the hardware on hand means we can continue to record events
throughout the year and every year for "free".

## See you in 2024!

Our [call for papers is already live](https://nor.dev/cfp); and plans are
already being made for the conference.

This year, we're looking to continue our monthly socials, and are in the process
of organising a Summer BBQ alongside our friends at SyncNorwich, Hot Source,
NGD, and Women In Tech.
