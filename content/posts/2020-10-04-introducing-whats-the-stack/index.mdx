## We've been exploring a range of new formats with our community, in part this has come with the new virtual requirements but it also comes as part of a drive to make our events more accessible and engaging. We're here announcing one of those new formats today:

Norfolk Developers would like to explore the stacks that drive our fine county. We’d like to explore your process and
how you go from A to B.

In short, we’re looking at how you:

- Analyse business/user requirements & translate those into user stories (or similar)
- Project manage the delivery of those requirements
- Deliver them
- And, Test/QA & gather feedback

The format for this will be a 15min lightning talks and we invite organisations (or makers) to join us and talk us
through their process. We'll invite 2-3 organisations to each event, and will then bring them together at the end as a
panel for Q&A.

These events will (can) also tie directly into a directory we will establish here, where we will list those
organisations and the stack they use.

## Suggested Talking Points

- What tools and/or methods do you use to gather user requirements?
  - Do you have “user groups”?
  - Regular meetings with customers?
  - Accept enhancement requests via GitHub, or with a product like Uservoice?
  - Dogfooding?
- What tools and/or methods do you use to translate user requirements into actions or user stories? And what methods do you use to prioritize these?
  - Regular meetings with account managers, support teams, or tech teams to explore user requirements, and or their own requests?
- What tools and/or methods do you use to manage the delivery?
  - Are you using PM tools (e.g. Jira, Trello etc)?
  - Methodologies like:- Agile, Scrum, Shape Up?
  - What aspects of the methodology do you find work best, and, perhaps what do you think is unique about your own version?
  - Is your team remote? Office based? Are you using standups?
- How are you delivering?
  - What’s your tech stack? (from back to front, or from schematic to consumer hardware)
  - What’s your local dev environment look like?
  - Are you using a UAT or staging environment?
  - VMs, Docker, Kubernetes?
  - Monorepo? Private package repositories?
  - Continuous Integration, Continuous deployment?
  - What’s your strategy for deployments (release branches, tagging, artifacts?)
- How are you testing, gathering QAs, or user feedback
  - This may be answered in part within the first question if relevant.
  - Do you operate unit, feature, e2e, or integration tests?
  - Live Chat for Customers?
  - Metrics (New Relic etc)

## Join Us?

If you're an organisation (or maker) and would like to show us your process and the tools of your trade please get in
