### A quick glance through this yearâ€™s NorDevCon schedule would give you the following brief, but insightful description of Onyiâ€™s talk in his own words:

> In my talk I will be sharing how tech leaders can develop their leadership distinction through my insights such as my 3 I's of Cutting Edge Leadership, the difference between a mindset and a state of mind and how to become legacy-minded in the era of creative distinction and beyond. I'll also share how to become more agile, disruptive and a future thinker using my ODA Leadership Modelâ„¢ and my insight below. The push for machine learning and deep learning is growing at an exponential rate, but the world is searching for creative and deep thinkers, the human learners who can create and deliver disruptive value on local, national and global platforms.

With that in mind, we decided to go the extra mile and ask our speaker some more questions to whet our audienceâ€™s appetite before the talk. Curious? Read the interview!
