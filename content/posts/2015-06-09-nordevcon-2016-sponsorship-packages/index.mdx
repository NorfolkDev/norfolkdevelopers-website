We're gearing up for [nor(DEV):con](http://www.nordevcon.com/) 2016 with the release of our sponsorship packages. We have various levels of sponsorship available for companies who would like to support Norfolk's tech conference and reap the benefits, in February next year, and now that the main conference is expanding to two days, there are more chances to reach your target audience! Options start from just Â£250. From sponsoring the sandwiches to naming a conference room, there's something for every budget.

You can find more details of our [packages here](http://www.nordevcon.com/sponsorship/) and download the [brochure here.](http://www.nordevcon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/norDevConSponsorship.pdf)
