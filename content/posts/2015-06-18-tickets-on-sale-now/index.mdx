Tickets for the 2016 [nor(DEV):con](http://www.nordevcon.com/) are now on sale, so if you want to get ahead of the game and grab a Super Early Bird ticket now's your chance!

Growing in popularity and still attracting visitors from across the country, as well as the world, nor(DEV):con has expanded to run over two and a half days. Thursday will see a full day of workshops, while Friday and Saturday will hold the conference talks, and we've already secured some big names.

There are limited numbers of the Super Early Birds, which are available at a very reduced rate, but once they're gone, they're gone! Tickets start from £20 and [are available here](http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/nordevcon-2016-tickets-15843460216) and there are 500 tickets available in total for conference spaces.
