In a collaborative effort to highlight and celebrate the contributions of women
in STEM, SheCanCode Corporate Ambassador Redgate Software recently worked with
us[sic] to create a series of empowering and insightful content during Women in
Engineering Week (October 7–11).

This week-long initiative showcased the incredible talent within
[Redgate](https://shecancode.io/company-profile/redgate/)’s
[engineering](https://shecancode.io/how-we-can-we-attract-and-retain-more-women-into-tech-and-engineering-roles/)
division while amplifying the voices of women in technology.

### A Week of Inspiration and Recognition

series of [events](https://shecancode.io/events/)—it was a statement of
commitment to inclusivity, innovation, and the advancement of women in
technology. The collaboration with SheCanCode is just one example of how
organisations can work together to drive meaningful change and create
opportunities for women to thrive in engineering and beyond.

amplifying diverse voices, sharing knowledge, and celebrating the achievements
