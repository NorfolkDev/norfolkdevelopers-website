# Unearth the fun at the intersection of people-ing and code-ing (in this particular case, also wizard-ing, bard-ing and many other magicalings! ‚ú®) with Pawel‚Äôs carefully crafted talk:


> Do you ever feel like you're surrounded by characters that are impossible to get along with and insufferable? Are they too loud and too breakneck or are they always silent? Do they ask too many questions or don't read emails at all? Are they late for meetings or suck all the air from the room? Trample everyone bluntly or beat around the bush endlessly? Adventures in a diverse team of wanderers in the land of IT can be a difficult challenge. Rude Warriors, narcissistic Bards, slow Druids and cold Wizards. Or maybe: brave Warriors, captivating Bards, soothing Druids and insightful Wizards? How to play the game of communication? Stay awhile and listen.
> *May contain a fair number of references to Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Game of Thrones, The Office, and more‚Ä¶

With this, Pawel has already set the geek-bar so incredibly high, we decided to go all-in and shower him with additional questions to let you revel in the abundance of information provided... As you do... üòâ

## üßô What inspired you to choose this particular topic for your talk?

**Pawel**: We had an internal presentation in our company about different personality types. I wanted to add a few more insights related to my technical background and wrap it in a role-playing games theme.

## üßô How do you think your talk will benefit software developers and programmers?

**Pawel**: Being able to communicate with different personalities is quite a universal asset. We have tons of technical content to learn from nowadays, but sometimes it‚Äôs the soft skills turn out to be crucial in our work.

## üßô If you could give us 1-3 main takeaways for your upcoming talk, what would they be?

**Pawel**:

* Awareness of individual differences and their impact
* Direct communication/presentation/moderation tips
* Opportunities and difficulties of diverse teams

## üßô Will there be any specific tools, technologies or frameworks that you will be talking about?

**Pawel**: It's not really technical ;)

## üßô What kind of audience engagement do you prefer?

**Pawel**: I‚Äôd love to answer the questions at the end of the talk!

## üßô Are there any ‚Äúteasers‚Äù you could give us?

**Pawel**: Possibly expect lots of references to pop culture characters that I've snuck into the talk to exemplify the four main personality types we can encounter in software development. Also: fantasy-themed visuals!

## üßô Finally, are there any additional links you would like us to include in the posts, so that people could find out more about you or check out your work?

**Pawel**: [https://howtotrainyourjava.com/](https://howtotrainyourjava.com/) ‚Äî not really about Java anymore, rather general software thoughts and peopleware.

We, of course, encourage you to meet Pawel up close and personal at the upcoming [NorDevCon 2024](https://ti.to/norfolkdevelopers/nordevcon-24), but if fate has it otherwise, you can also check out his work (see above) and get in touch with him via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pawe%C5%82zaj%C4%85czkowski)


If you haven't already, you can, of course, get the tickets to see Pawel and other speakers at our [Conference](https://ti.to/norfolkdevelopers/nordevcon-24).


Thanks,
