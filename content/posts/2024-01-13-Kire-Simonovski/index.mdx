### Explore Kire's upcoming presentation and get an early glimpse at the extra details our speaker has provided!

If you follow the link to our [website](https://nordevcon.com), you will see the following description of Mr Simonovski’s upcoming Keynote:

> "In this session, we will provide a comprehensive overview of Microsoft Azure Functions, discussing how to build and deploy functions using .NET and C#. You will gain a solid understanding of the core concepts, including function triggers, bindings, and input/output integrations."

So, because we're the kind of tech geeks who love diving deep into things (maybe a bit too much!), we've decided to dig even further into the topic. We have e-cornered and thrown some additional questions at our speaker to grab some extra nuggets of wisdom!

## What inspired you to choose this particular topic for your talk?

**Kire**: The inspiration behind choosing the topic for my talk comes from the huge potential of serverless computing and its seamless integration with the whole .NET ecosystem when using Microsoft Azure. Azure Functions provide a robust framework for developing scalable and event-driven applications, making it a game-changer in modern software architecture if utilised correctly. I am excited to share insights and introduction into the practical aspects of building, deploying, and triggering Azure Functions using .NET and C#, as this knowledge is essential for fellow developers and engineers to stay ahead in the dynamic landscape of cloud computing.

## Who would find your talk useful?

**Kire**: The talk is tailored to bring introductory level knowledge to software developers and engineers in general. By delving into the intricacies of serverless computing specifically within the Azure ecosystem, I hope attendees will gain an insights into creating, deploying and integrating scalable and efficient azure functions using .NET and C#.

The talk not only equips attendees with the introductory technical know-how to implement Azure Functions effectively but also inspires innovation and efficiency in software development practices in general, so it should be beneficial across a broad spectrum of roles within the Software Development industry.

## If you could give us 1-3 main takeaways for your upcoming talk, what would they be?

**Kire**:

1. Understanding of Azure functions and serverless computing - Gain a thorough comprehension of Azure Functions and their role in modern software development, particularly when integrated with .NET and C#.
2. Practical Application - Observe hands-on techniques for building, deploying, and triggering Azure Functions, empowering attendees to implement serverless solutions effectively in their projects.
3. Enhanced Efficiency: Discover strategies to optimize software development processes, promoting agility and scalability through the adoption of serverless architecture within the Azure ecosystem.

## Will there be any specific tools, technologies or frameworks that you will be talking about?

**Kire**: Through the talk we will observe how to create and deploy azure functions using Visual Studio, Azure Portal, .NET Framework and C# as a language of choice.

## What kind of audience engagement do you prefer?

**Kire**: I plan to reserve a dedicated time at the end of the talk for a comprehensive Q&A session as this is an introductory talk, and I expect an audience of engineers of all levels.

This approach allows attendees that are not familiar with the topic to absorb the foundational concepts of serverless computing and functions first before engaging into conversation and Q&A.

By providing this structured engagement, the aim is to achieve balance, offering an inclusive experience where everyone has a fair chance to understand the topic thoroughly before delving into more interactive discussions.

## Are there any “teasers” you could give us?

**Kire**: Although the talk is about introduction into Serverless computing and Azure functions in particular, the audience can anticipate not only a clearer understanding of the topics above but also expect to see from this session how Azure functions can transform software architecture and reshape our approach when planning new projects.

## Finally, are there any additional links you would like us to include in the posts, so that people could find out more about you or check out your work?
