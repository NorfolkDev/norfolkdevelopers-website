### Creativity comes in many forms, and one of our speakers, Angeliki, drew it from a somewhat more unusual of the sources ‚Äî the pop culture!

A quick glance through this year‚Äôs [NorDevCon](https://nordevcon.com) schedule would give you the following brief, but insightful description of Angeliki‚Äôs talk:

> Developers are a curious kind of creature. Often found in the wild lands of product development, they create magical solutions by bringing requirements to life. As a Change Manager and big fan of the Avengers, I am fascinated by what I can achieve with them. However, due to misconceptions around the value and timing for Change Management, a question remains. How do you bring such different skill sets together to fight the battle against terrible DevOps implementations? Whilst many turn to ChatGPT, I am here to share with you what I learned from the Avengers about bringing a diverse team together. From fighting monsters in New York, to the absolute end game with the infinity stones, they can teach us a lot about dealing with adversity to bring change, enterprise, or small scale. After all, they also share a common mission despite a very diverse background. Through parallels between the Avengers and DevOps implementation teams, as well as the core principles of building robust and scalable applications, we will focus on defining what matters; Smart collaboration to make users the heroes of every solution story and empower them to navigate a world of continuous tech transformation.

That being said, we decided to go a step further and spoil our community (as well as, hopefully, future audience!) with a bit more of a sneak-peak into the upcoming talk by interviewing Ms Patsiavou, and encouraging her to give us a bit more of an insight on her upcoming speech!

## ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è What inspired you to choose this particular topic for your talk?

**Angeliki**: Having worked with various DevOps teams, I wanted to share my personal experience and how their superpowers can come to life if we welcome diverse skill sets. By creating fusion teams which include citizen developers, change managers and general business technologists, we can truly build Minimum Lovable Products.

## ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How would you say your talk would benefit the developers, or professionals in other fields? 

**Angeliki**: Everyone loves the Avengers because a group of seemingly powerful misfits came together to save the world. Almost like an IT project saved from being a car crash with users. This will benefit developers and programmers see how bringing a business perspective into traditional DevOps settings and diversifying skill sets can benefit them. There will be a few practical examples of how they can champion accessibility, usability and user-centered design to improve their product quality, business networks, and ultimately adoption of their hard work.

## ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è If you could give us 1-3 main takeaways for your upcoming talk, what would they be?

**Angeliki**:
* ‚ö°Ô∏è How to create an adoption-driven CI/ CD strategy to design ecosystems with intention
* ‚ö°Ô∏è Accessibility is everyone's responsibility both in our code and building teams
* ‚ö°Ô∏è Fusion DevOps teams are the way to remain connected during the AI evolution of our roles

## ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Are there any specific tools, technologies, or frameworks that you will be discussing in your talk?

**Angeliki:**

* ‚ö°Ô∏è Iceberg of Ignorance
* ‚ö°Ô∏è PROSCI
* ‚ö°Ô∏è WCAG
* ‚ö°Ô∏è SCRUM

## ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è What kind of audience engagement do you prefer, if any?

**Angeliki:** I would love for people to engage throughout by sharing their experiences or ask questions. There will be a dedicated Q&A after too.

## ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Are there any ‚Äúteasers‚Äù you could give us?

**Angeliki:** What do you think a DevOps team and the Avengers have in common? Do you find yourself with secret superpowers others do not know, or you cannot seem to share? Let's dive into the world of user-centered design, so your architecture leads to Minimum Lovable Products with max quality code and min tech debt!

## ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Finally, are there any additional links you would like us to include in the posts, so that people could find out more about you or check out your work?

**Angeliki:** Sure, here is my blog [https://www.empoweredhumans.net/](https://www.empoweredhumans.net/)
