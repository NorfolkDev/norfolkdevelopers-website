It’s just two months until the largest tech conference in the east - the Norfolk Developers’ conference - opens its doors. And what a collection of delights are in store for you.

As a result of the pandemic, we couldn’t hold this event in 2021. This year we are back with some very special speakers and workshops.

## Evergreen favourites

We have returning popular speakers, including Jim Marshall, who in 2020 wowed us with his drumming proficiency as well as his invigorating speech. This year Jim will be talking about leadership self awareness. The incomparable Dom Davis will entertain and enlighten us with a talk on the Andromeda strain. And another popular returnee, Paul Grenyer, will divulge the conference origins and why it’s so important for the east of England and the UK’s tech sector.

## New stars

We’re also delighted to introduce a few newbies to our platform. Former software engineer, and current Mindset coach, Richard Donovan, will explain the importance of de-stressing and confidence building and how developers can and should look after their mental health. The User Story’s Katie Fisher will be highlighting the importance of listening to clients through UX.

Watch out for some fascinating talks on crypto, ethereum and Web 3, including a tasty explanation on Blockchain from Cambridge University Bitcoin society.

## Tech in the east

To put the importance of the Norfolk Developers’ conference into context, the 2021 [Tech Nation Report](https://technation.io/report2021/) stated that 2020 figures revealed that Norwich ranks 13th in the UK and can boast £27m investment in its tech sector. Taking the east of England as a whole, the east recorded a £220b investment.in 2020.

## Even more

Up until the conference itself we’ll be running a series of interviews with speakers and, of course, our wonderful sponsors.

Tickets are going fast but you have until 16 May to grab our Early Bird ticket.
