**Norfolk Developers almost need no introduction. If you’re reading this magazine, you know who they are. Considering the group’s importance and influence in the region’s tech scene, they were an obvious choice to feature in our ‘Meet The Community’ feature. We spoke to founder Paul Grenyer about nor(DEV): about his favourite moment of past meet-ups and what the future holds for the deep-tech group.**

**When were you founded?**

July 2013, by Paul Grenyer, Dom Davis & Ben Taylor

**What inspired you to start Norfolk Developers?**

Paul Grenyer started a group 18 months before, called Agile East Anglia (<https://tinyurl.com/bwrbafj>), which was one of the groups which merged to form [SyncNorwich](https://www.meetup.com/syncnorwich/) in 2012. After he left SyncNorwich, Paul ran a small MongoDB based meetup group, which had three events, before he realised there was an appetite for a purely technical group in Norwich. So he formed Norfolk Developers with Ben and Dom.

**How has Norfolk developers evolved since it first began?**

In lots of ways. As well as regular monthly evening events featuring two, fortyfive minute tech sessions, Norfolk Developers now also run quarterly breakfasts and a monthly networking event call NorDevBiz. The jewel in the crown is the yearly Norfolk Developers Conference. Norfolk Developers as also run lunches and Agile on the Bench sessions in the past.

**Is it what you imagined it would be now?**

No, it’s much bigger and does so much more.

**What is your favourite part/memory/aspect of Norfolk Developers?**

When Robert “Uncle Bob” Martin came to speak a packed room just before Christmas 2015: <http://paulgrenyer.blogspot.co.uk/2015/12/uncle-bob-comes-to-norwich.html>

**And the groups greatest achievement?**

Probably over 400 people for the main conference day in 2016.

**Where do you see Norfolk Developers going in the future?**

Hopefully the membership will continue to grow. Attendance will grow and it will help Norwich and Norfolk be seen as the place where tech entrepreneurs come to start their businesses.

**One thing people might not know about Norfolk Developers?**

Norfolk Developers meetups were originally held in Virgin Wine’s meeting room at St. James Mill before moving to the King's Centre.
