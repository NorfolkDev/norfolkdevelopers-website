Today I want to talk a little bit about [useReducer](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer) and how it can be used as a fantastic way to manage complex state requirements without reaching for a library or peppering your codebase with multiple [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) calls.

In the following example, we are going to look at a users profile card which in the real world, would allow a user to update their first name, last name, email and phone.

We are also going to do this with TypeScript so that we get that sweet sweet type safety that it brings to the table.

All of the code for this example will be available [here](https://github.com/damiensedgwick/useref-demo).

Lets crack on.

To use `useReducer` we must first call it and pass it a reducer function, and an initial state object:

```tsx
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(handleFormInputChange, {
  firstName: "",
  lastName: "",
  email: "",
  phone: "",
  submitted: false
});
```
The `state` here is pretty self-explanatory, but what is `dispatch` and what does `handleFormInputChange` actually handle?

If we take a look at the latter, `handleFormInputChange` is our reducer function that takes in the current state and an action.

Lets take a look at the code:

```ts
export type Data = {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email: string;
  phone: string;
  submitted: boolean;
}

export type Action =
  { type: "UPDATE_FIRST_NAME", value: string }
  | { type: "UPDATE_LAST_NAME", value: string }
  | { type: "UPDATE_EMAIL", value: string }
  | { type: "UPDATE_PHONE", value: string }
  | { type: "RESET_FORM" }
  | { type: "SUBMIT_FORM" }

export const handleFormInputChange = (state: Data, action: Action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "UPDATE_FIRST_NAME":
      return { ...state, firstName: action.value, submitted: false };
    case "UPDATE_LAST_NAME":
      return { ...state, lastName: action.value, submitted: false };
    case "UPDATE_EMAIL":
      return { ...state, email: action.value, submitted: false };
    case "UPDATE_PHONE":
      return { ...state, phone: action.value, submitted: false };
    case "SUBMIT_FORM":
      return { ...state, submitted: true };
    case "RESET_FORM":
      return { firstName: "", lastName: "", email: "", phone: "", submitted: false };
    default:
      throw new Error("Unhandled form input action");
  }
};
```
So our `state` takes the shape of `Data` which is the first part we have declared here, the second part is our `Action` type which will help us when it comes to dispatching events a little later.

Lastly, we have declared our function, this is simply a switch statement that checks the action type, and handles it accordingly. If we were to send an action that we had not declared, it would throw a new error.

So for example, if we send the action type `UPDATE_FIRST_NAME`, the function would return all state that has not been modified, as well as the new state for the input element that has been modified, like so:

```tsx
...
case "UPDATE_FIRST_NAME":
    return { ...state, firstName: action.value, submitted: false };
...
```
Now that we have looked at our reducer function, lets look at `dispatch`.

`dispatch` allows us to use our reducer function to send events and values. In the case of our first name input field, it looks like this:

```tsx
<Input placeholder="First Name" value={state.firstName} onChange={(e) => dispatch({ type: "UPDATE_FIRST_NAME", value: e.target.value })} />
```
So as we can see, whenever `onChange` is called for this input element, we send the action type and the value using dispatch, and our reducer function handles updating the correct piece of state.

If we take a step back and look at our users profile component, it lets us see the whole picture for the component.

```tsx
<ProfileCard>
  <UserDetailsForm>
    <Avatar src={avatar} alt="the users avatar" />
    <FormGroup>
      <Input placeholder="First Name" value={state.firstName} onChange={(e) => dispatch({ type: "UPDATE_FIRST_NAME", value: e.target.value })} />
      <Input placeholder="Last Name" value={state.lastName} onChange={(e) => dispatch({ type: "UPDATE_LAST_NAME", value: e.target.value })} />
      <Input placeholder="Email" value={state.email} onChange={(e) => dispatch({ type: "UPDATE_EMAIL", value: e.target.value })} />
      <Input placeholder="Phone" value={state.phone} onChange={(e) => dispatch({ type: "UPDATE_PHONE", value: e.target.value })} />
    </FormGroup>
    <Button type="button" onClick={() => state.submitted ? dispatch({ type: "RESET_FORM" }) : dispatch({ type: "SUBMIT_FORM" })}>{state.submitted ? "RESET" : "SAVE"}</Button>
  </UserDetailsForm>
</ProfileCard>
```
As you can see, all of the `onChange` handlers and the `onClick` handler are very simple. All we are doing is using `dispatch` to send an action type and a potential value should one be required.

No more tracking multiple input fields with useState and declaring different call handlers for different elements.

The entire form can be handled using one function and one state object.

I also mentioned the use of TypeScript here, but I didn't really explain why it was beneficial.

The reason it is beneficial in this example, is that we would get an error should we try and pass a value along with an event, that did not accept a value.

So if we tried to do:
```tsx
onClick={() => dispatch({type: SUBMIT_FORM, value: "some value"})
```
It would error because the action `SUBMIT_FORM` is not expecting any other value to be sent with the event.
