## How smart phones have made the web dumb.

Is it just me or has the modern web become, kind of boring? I have been fortunate enough to see the web evolve from its early days of finding it's feet with the public to the behemoth it is today. Over time it feels like we have gone full circle. Websites started out simple and functional, then evolved some more depth with multiple pages, navigation and new UI. Eventually we got broadband that gave us internet speeds able to deliver bigger webpages, faster and as a result a boom of creativity in the industry of web design.

### Where we started
The very first websites we as basic as they could be, pure function with little in the way of styling and imagery. Restricted by the capabilities of the browser, the languages and of course the speed of the internet. A copy of the [very first website](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/web-design-history/tim-berners-lee-created-the-first-website-1991) is still available today.  Even some of the most iconic websites had humble begins, just check out the original Amazon homepage from 1995.

Websites started to get a bit more styling and imagery over time but were still quite limited.
### The implementation of broadband
Once broadband landed in the homes of UK residents back in 2000, thing started to change. We had more capabilities with the languages we used as well as being able to serve up more due to faster internet. 
With this came a new wave of creativity in web design. We went from simple menus to wonderfully interactive sites like Supertotto.

Or maybe even Engine, another example of a creative UI.

### Introducing the iPhone
Fast forward to the year 2007 and you will find the introduction of the iPhone. The worlds first successful smart phone. The sheer popularity of Smart Phones finally allowed users a way to browse the web with ease from their mobile phone and presented a new challenge for web design, how to make websites work well on such a small screen?
