We're glad you're here! We've been working on this for a few weeks just to get the basics in place, but now we want to invite you to come and help us build.

This website is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) & Hosted with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), but to contribute to the development of the website a basic understanding of [React](https://reactjs.org/) will suffice.

We're also very keen to receive contributions to our Posts, and whilst this may seem a little overwhelming the process is actually quite simple:

We're also happy to take your contributions in whichever format you prefer, [email us](mailto:info@norfolkdevelopers.com) your articles and we'll get it up on the site asap.

If you'd like to get involved and are unsure how to then reach out to us, we'd be happy to help onboard you. Give us a hola on [Discord](https://discord.gg/WQwrYrS), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NorfolkDev), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/company/norfolk-developers-ltd-/)!
