### Pre-Conference Events

Every year we kick off nor(DEV):con with our pre-conference session at the King's Centre which is **free** to attend, we start early at 5pm with two 30 minute sessions, with all the usual refreshments, this will be followed by our pre-conference dinner which is attended by some of the speakers and the organisers of the conference.

Last years pre-conference dinner at [the Library](http://www.thelibraryrestaurant.co.uk/#welcome) was such a success we’re going back for seconds.

#### Wine Reception, Conference Dinner & T-Shirts

We are pleased to announce we’ve extended the capacity of our wine reception which is sponsored for a second year by “Wines & Business Club”. This, for the first time, will take place in the main Auditorium at the King's Centre. This event is still free to attend so don’t forget to add the ticket to your order so we can keep the wine flowing until our wonderful conference dinner which is still limited to 80 places.

Every year our conference dinner offers an intimate opportunity to network with our speakers and other delegates. This is an event for those interested in engaging with other business decision makers and those wishing to gain valuable insight into where the digital economy trends are heading in a relaxed setting with a stunning three course meal. Guests are shuffled around the various speaker tables ensuring each course is accompanied by different opportunities to network and socialise. Dinner includes 2 glasses of wine and a choice of courses from the menu, all for **£42.39 inc. fees.**

Conference Dinner tickets can be purchased from our website [www.nordevcon.com](http://www.nordevcon.com/).

Conference T-shirts are **free**, so to get yours just add the ticket to your order and collect them with your delegate pack at registration on the day.

#### Good Cause

This year, the local good cause we shall be supporting is based in the partly cobbled streets of Colgate, The Women’s Centre offers women a wide range of opportunities and support services to offer women support for homelessness, domestic violence, mental health issues and range of other important social issues facing the women in the city of Norwich and wider Norfolk, the centre has become a haven for those who have felt or faced social exclusion, whatever the circumstances. Women can receive free advice on accommodation, access to education and counselling as well as access free skills development and employment supportive services and we hope to increase support for this valuable yet little known deserving cause.

We’ve crammed nor(DEV):con full of great content. Your only challenges now are to choose which sessions to attend and convincing your boss to pay!

We look forward to seeing you in February!
