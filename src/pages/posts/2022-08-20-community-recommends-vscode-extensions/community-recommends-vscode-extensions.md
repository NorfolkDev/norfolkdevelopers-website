# Community Recommends: VSCode Extensions

Recently, I reached out to our community on the [NorDev Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/WQwrYrS) to get some recommendations on extensions for VSCode. I already had a few in mind but I figured there's no better place to get some solid opions so here are the community recommendations.

## Prettier
![Prettier](Prettier.jpg)
[Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) is a code formatter, and a very popular one too!  
In their own words: 
> Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.   

Now if you are new to coding and just starting out it may be worth skipping this one for a little while, just to ensure you learn best practices and don't become entirely reliant on a code formatter to keep your work legible.   
That said, the main reason this was chosen as a popular option by the community is the fact it allows you to worry less on the legibility of your code and instead focus more on the code itself.   
If you need to get in the zone and simply write the code without little worry or regard to formatting and other nuances then this is a great recommendation.  

## Live Server
![Live Server](Live_Server_Logo.jpg)
[Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) is a fanstatic tool when you are working on sites that are comprised of nothing more than HTML, CSS and Javascript.   
Live Server provides you with a way to view your code as you would on, well, a live server. It auto updates as you save your code and is a great companion for a second screen (or split screen) set up so you can see the changes as you make them.   
As a new coder I found this to be really useful, I knew almost instantly that the changes I were making were either working or not. It's great for experimental learning.   

## Live Share
![Live Share](Live_Share.jpg)
[Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack) is the definitive extension for sharing your projects and pair programming and working collaboratively remotely, all provided by Microsoft themselves.   
In their own words:
> This extension pack includes everything you need to start collaboratively editing and debugging in real time, including integrated audio and text chat. This provides you and your team/class with a one-click installation, in order to begin pair programming, performing remote code reviews, driving interactive lectures, and more, without needing to leave Visual Studio Code.   

I can't put it much better than that really, long story short, if you need a friend to help you with your code or you intend to pair programme, work collaboratively and want to work in real time then this the one for you.  
A strong choice from the community.   

## GitLens
![GitLens](GitLens.jpg)
[GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) is an extension that adds extra features to Git.   
To quote the experts:
> Supercharge Git within VS Code â€” Visualize code authorship at a glance via Git blame annotations and CodeLens, seamlessly navigate and explore Git repositories, gain valuable insights via rich visualizations and powerful comparison commands, and so much more.   

Pretty self explanatory, not sure how else I can elaborate on that other than saying that it sure is a popular option and it comes from the trusty people at GitKraken, a little more from them below.

> GitLens supercharges Git inside VS Code and unlocks untapped knowledge within each repository. It helps you to visualize code authorship at a glance via Git blame annotations and CodeLens, seamlessly navigate and explore Git repositories, gain valuable insights via rich visualizations and powerful comparison commands, and so much more.   

That's all I'm saying other than check it out!
